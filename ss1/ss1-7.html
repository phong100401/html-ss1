<p> The Internet is a network of networks. That is,
    computer networks are linked to other networks, spanning
    countries and today the globe. The TCP/IP transfer protocol
    provides the bindings that connect all these computers the
    world over.</p>

<br>
<p> Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard language that
    the Web uses for creating and reconizing documents. Although
    not a subset of, it is loosely related to the Standard Generalized
    Markup Language (SGML). SGML is a method for representing document
    formatting languages.</p>
<a name="Consistency">Unity and Variety</a>
<br>
<p> A basic rule is that of unity and variety. That is, everything
    should fit together as a unit, but at the same time there is enough
    variety to keep things interesting. Consistency creates and reinforces
    the unique identity of a site. Colors, fonts, column layout and other
    desin elements should be consistent throughout every section of the site</p>
